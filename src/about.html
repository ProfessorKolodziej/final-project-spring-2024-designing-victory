	<h1 class="welcome"> Welcome!</h1>
	<p class="welcome-intro"> Welcome to Designing Victory, where every triumph finds its unique expression.
		<br>
		<br>
		Rooted in the belief that sports transcend mere competition, our platform invites you to embark on a journey of
		personal victory. Born from the culmination of an academic endeavor, Designing Victory extends the vision of unity
		and celebration explored in our thesis project.
		<br>
		<br>
		Here, we offer you the canvas to craft your own Victory Jersey, a tangible symbol of your triumphs, passions, and
		aspirations. Whether it's a triumphant buzzer-beater, a hard-fought marathon finish, or a quiet moment of personal
		growth, your story is the heartbeat of our platform.
		<br>
		<br>
		Our mission is simple yet profound: to illuminate the transformative power of design in celebrating individual
		narratives and fostering inclusivity within the sports community. Through the lens of innovative design, we bridge
		the gap between the excitement of competition and the enduring unity it inspires.
		<br>
		<br>
		Designing Victory isn't just about commemorating victories; it's about recognizing the inherent power of every
		individual's journey. It's about acknowledging that in the tapestry of sports, every story matters, every triumph
		is significant, and every fan deserves to celebrate their moment of glory.
		<br>
		<br>
		Join us as we embark on this journey together, where design becomes the conduit for reflection, celebration, and
		the unifying force that binds us all in the rich tapestry of the sports world. Welcome to Designing Victoryâ€”where
		every victory finds its voice.
